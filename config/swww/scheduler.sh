This will use the 'at' command to schedule the image switch.
You can control the transition fps or step by passing the respective options:
	$0 'path/to/img --transition-fps 60 --transition-step 5' '18:00'

# NOTE: the above line is really the only one that matters, so if you are
# making a script and want to schedule a bunch of things at once, I recommend
# creating a function, like:
#
# swww_schedule() {
#     echo "swww img $1" | at "$2"
# }
#
# Then, you can simply call:
#     swww_schedule <path/to/img> <HH:MM>
# as many time as you need
